# Tech Stack Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the technology stack for the habit tracking app with community features. The stack is designed to be lean, efficient, and scalable, focusing on core functionalities while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

## Frontend

- **Framework**: React Native  
  Chosen for its ability to build cross-platform mobile apps.

- **Tooling**: Expo  
  Simplifies handling of native features and builds.

- **UI Components**: React Native Paper or NativeBase  
  For consistent and visually appealing UI across components.

## Backend

- **Platform**: Supabase  
  Open-source alternative to Firebase, offering real-time databases, authentication, and storage.

- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
  Robust relational database managed by Supabase.

## Authentication

- **Provider**: Supabase  
  Supports email/password and OAuth providers like Google.

## State Management

- **Current**: React's useState and useContext  
  Sufficient for initial development.

- **Future Consideration**: Redux or Recoil  
  For more complex state management as the app grows.

## Testing

- **Frontend**: Jest and React Testing Library  
  For unit and component testing.

- **Backend**: Supabase utilities or custom integration tests  
  To ensure API endpoints function correctly.

## Version Control

- **System**: Git  
- **Hosting**: GitHub or GitLab  
  For collaboration and backup.

## Deployment

- **Frontend**: Expo  
  For building and deploying the React Native app.

- **Backend**: Supabase  
  For deploying and managing backend services.

## Additional Considerations

- **Performance Optimization**:  
  - Consider using React Native Performance Monitor or lazy loading for components.

- **Security**:  
  - Ensure data is securely stored and transmitted, configuring Supabase security features correctly.

- **Scalability**:  
  - Supabase and React Native are well-suited for scaling as the user base grows.

## Future Enhancements

- **Push Notifications**:  
  - Consider adding push notification capabilities using Expo's services if reminders are introduced.

- **Design Library**:  
  - Use a UI library like React Native Paper or NativeBase for consistent design.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**:  
  - Implement continuous integration and deployment for automated testing and deployment.

## Conclusion

This tech stack is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing for easy maintenance and future expansions.
